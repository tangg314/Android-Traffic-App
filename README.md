#Android Traffic App
ICS 414 Team Khoya

Team Khoya consisted of Gary Tang (leader), Ashley Fagaragan, and Melissa Gushiken. As a team, we developed an Android traffic app for our class, ICS 414. The app utilizes an ambient device that displays the traffic level of the user’s route. Google Maps’ API was used to gather the traffic data. The ambient devices included a lock screen widget, a home screen widget, and the phone’s notification light. These devices displayed the following colors; green for light traffic, yellow for medium traffic, and red for heavy traffic. The user route’s speed and ETA are displayed and are updated at a set interval. An interactive map displays the traffic levels of the user’s route and the surrounding area. The user is able use the map to retrieve turn by turn directions via Google Maps.
